## Course Description
In this class, you will learn about information visualization techniques and their applications in a variety of fields. Through lectures and doing homework assignments and projects, you will learn and practice how to derive a visualization solution by integrating data mining methods, statistical methods, 3D graphics techniques, findings in human visual perception studies, concepts and techniques in art, and ideas found in several other areas. While this is an introductory course, students are also expected to read, critique, and present research papers. You can take this class if you have received undergraduate training in computer science. However, you will be able to pursue advanced topics for your final project if you have taken ECS163, ECS175, or ECS177 (or equivalent) before.

## Assignment and Project
There are four homework assignments and one final project. Please find all the materials, including descriptions, tutorials, guidelines, and coding templates, from the folder assigned for each assignment and project in this GitHub repository.
