# Assignment 3: Visualization Dashboard

In this assignment, you will be learning how to implement a dashboard with two visualization views. You can use either JavaScript with [D3.js](https://d3js.org) or Python with [Dash](https://dash.plot.ly/?_ga=2.191292847.426805754.1574706741-53947978.1573166595) to do this assignment. 

To help get you started, a template will be provided for setting up the application and load the dataset. Your task is then to implement a visualization dashboard. The design of this dashboard should facilitate analysis of the dataset in an effective or interesting way. This dashboard must have two visualization views. Your visualizations should include one basic and one advanced visualization methods. The two visualizations should depict different dimensions or aspects of the dataset to be examined. You can also support visual analysis techniques, such as context + focus. For instance, a bubble chart can be used as a primary view while selecting a bubble, a bar chart may be used to display extra information.


### Examples of basic visualization methods
* Bar chart
* Pie or donut chart
* Line and area chart
* 2D heatmap or matrix view
* Scatter plot or bubble chart
* Node-link diagram
* Geographical map

### Examples of more advanced visualization methods
* Parallel set or parallel coordinates plot
* Sankey or alluvial diagram
* Star coordinates or plot
* Chord diagram
* Stream graph
* Arc diagram

For each view, you need to provide one or more visual interface widgets (e.g., a dropdown menu or slider) for changing the parameters of the visualization. For examples, a drop-down menu can be provided for selecting the data dimension that maps to the x-axis of a scatter plot or the color encoding used in a 2D heatmap.

## Submission
To submit this assignment, create a new folder inside the Assignment 2 directory in the forked repository for Assignment 1. The name of the folder should be the same as your UC Davis email account name (without ' @ucdavis.edu'). Put all your codes inside this folder, and use "git add" to add all your codes. After commit and push all the codes to your own repository, create a pull request by following the same procedure used for Assignment 1 (see instructions [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork)). To complete your submission, submit the hyperlink of the pull request in UCD Canvas.
