# Assignment 1

In this assignment, you need to choose a dataset and create three visualizations to show two different insights. For visualization, you can choose to use Jupyter Notebook (Python), Observable Notebook (JavaScript), or Tableau (GUI).  This is an individual assignment, so you may not work in groups. Your final submission will take the form of a report including the visualizations you created and the description of the insights you gained from the visualizations.

### Step 1: Choose a dataset from the list below

* [LAX Passenger Counts by Terminal](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Los-Angeles-International-Airport-Passenger-Traffi/g3qu-7q2u)
* [Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)
* [2014 Kansas City Crime Data](https://data.kcmo.org/Crime/crime-data/9u7z-x596)


### Step 2: Choose a visualization tool 

* [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) (Python)
* [Observable Notebook](http://observablehq.com/) (JavaScript)
* [Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/en-us/s/) (GUI)

You can use one of these visualization tools based on your interest. If you're more interested in data analysis and exploration, we recommend using Python with Jupyter Notebook. If you're more interested in visualization design, user interface, and HCI, we recommend using JavaScript with Observable Notebook. If you are unsure or your major is not Computer Science, you can choose to use Tableau, which provides GUI for creating visualizations.

### Step 3: Load and process the data

Next, you are going to load the chosen dataset to your selected tool for processing and visualization. For Jupyter and Observable, please refer to coding templates provided in the example folder. For Tableau, just use the GUI to load and process the data.

To process and transform the data for analysis, we recommend the following: 

* Jupyter Notebook: [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (data processing and analysis library for Python)
* Observable: [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) (declarative grammars for data transformations and visualization)
* Tableau: its GUI provides basic operations for processing and transforming data; you can refer to [this tutorial](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tableau/index.htm) to learn how to use Tableau if you want

### Step 4: Analyze and visualize the data

For visualizing the data, you can use the following: 
* Seaborn[Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) or [Altair](https://altair-viz.github.io/) for Jupyter Notebook
* [Vega-Lite](https://vega.github.io/vega-lite/) for Observable Notebook
* For Tableau, just play with the GUI to create visualizations; if needed, please refer to the [tutorial on how to use Tableau](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/tableau/index.htm)

## Submission
If you are using Jupyter Notebook, you can commit the notebook to GitHub and submit the link to the repository. For Observable Notebook, you can submit the link for sharing your notebook for this assignment. For Tableau, you would need to submit a report containing the visualizations you created in Tableau.
