# Assignment 1

In this assignment, you need to choose a dataset and create three visualizations to show two different insights. For visualization, you can choose to use Jupyter Notebook (Python), Observable Notebook (JavaScript), or Tableau (GUI).  This is an individual assignment, so you may not work in groups. Your final submission will take the form of a report including the visualizations you created and the description of the insights you gained from the visualizations.

### Step 1: Choose a dataset from the list

* [LAX Passenger Counts by Terminal](https://data.lacity.org/A-Prosperous-City/Los-Angeles-International-Airport-Passenger-Traffi/g3qu-7q2u)
* [Film Locations in San Francisco](https://data.sfgov.org/Culture-and-Recreation/Film-Locations-in-San-Francisco/yitu-d5am)
* [2014 Kansas City Crime Data](https://data.kcmo.org/Crime/crime-data/9u7z-x596)



## Submission
If you are usings Jupyter Notebook, you can commit the notebook to GitHub and submit the link to the repository. For Observable Notebook, you can submit the link for sharing your notebook for this assignment. For Tableau, you would need to submit a report containing the visualizations you created in Tableau.
