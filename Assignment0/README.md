# Assignment 0

In this assignment, your task is to find a visualization that is "in the wild" somewhere out there on the Internet. Find what you believe is a good or interesting example of information visualization. Of course, since it's early in the quarter, and we haven't completely defined what makes a visualization "good," we don't expect you to find a flawless example, but do your best! You will then create a single HTML file to do the following:

* Show the title and your name in the HTML header
* Use a HTML img tag to show the image of the visualization (e.g. set the src property to be the hyperlink or URL of the image).
* Use css to modify the style of your HTML page where the visualization should be horizontally aligned to the middle of the page.
* Put the hyperlink to the source page that you got the visualization from.
* Write a short, text description of the visualization at the bottom.

Your text description should be a small paragraphs, and answer the following:
* What is being shown? (required)
* Is the visualization interactive or static? If interactive, how can it be interacted with?(required)
* What are some of the design choices and visualization techniques used? These include * things like choice of color or color palettes, the type of plot/chart used, the interaction techniques, etc.(optional)
* What, in your opinion, is the rationale behind the design choices? (optional)
* Do you think this is a good visualization? Give a short critique on why or why not. (required)

Your HTML page does not have to be elaborately styled, but please make it clean-looking and succinct.
